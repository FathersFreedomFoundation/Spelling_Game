Spelling Game for Ben and Sara 🎮📚
This project is an educational spelling game designed for two players, Ben and Sara, to enhance their spelling skills while having fun. The game is inspired by the classic Hangman game and features two different word sets tailored to their grade levels. Ben’s set includes 3rd-grade-level words, and Sara’s set includes 4th-grade-level words.

The game rewards players with a virtual punch on their punch cards after every 10 successfully spelled words. The objective is to help them improve their spelling while encouraging progress with a fun and interactive experience.
